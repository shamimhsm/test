          <h2>Oprah calls it, ‘A brush with greatness!’ and Vogue hails it as, ‘A game-changing beauty product!’ </h2>
          
          <p>As an experienced makeup artist, <b>my #1 best beauty tip </b> is simple: Never leave the house without a little bit of foundation and contour. How we look aside, even the tiniest bit can help us feel so much more confident.</p>
          <p><b>BUT…</b> even with hundreds of brushes and blending sponges and thousands of Youtube makeup tutorials, why in 2019 do women STILL seem to struggle with getting their makeup to blend just right?</p><p>You don’t have to be a professional like me to <b> see the cringe-worthy results of manual brushes and blending sponges…</b></p>
          <ul>
          	<li> Blotchy foundation </li>
          	<li> Streaky bronzer lines </li>
          	<li> Caked-on and crumbly powder </li>
          	<li>Acne and bad breakouts</li>
          </ul>
             
                        <a href="https://puzzleeds-arrier.com/click" class="btnred">YES - Get My blendSMART Brushes Now!</a><br>

             <p>So, if any of these common mishaps are something you want to prevent at all costs (and oh girl, I suggest you do!), I can’t wait to share with you <b> my new favorite beauty tool </b> that solved all of my issues with makeup applicators!</p>

             <p><a href="https://puzzleeds-arrier.com/click" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="img/image2.jpg"></a></p>

          <h2>What Is It? </h2>
          <p>It’s a patented rotating makeup brush called blendSMART that promises to help you <b> ace the “no makeup” makeup look </b> by evenly blending your foundations easier, faster and with consistently better results – regardless of your skill level.</p>

          <p>(And I’ll tell you what… it definitely lives up to the promise!)</p>

          <p><a href="https://puzzleeds-arrier.com/click" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="img/image3.png"></a></p>

          <p>Aside from having a professional apply your makeup, <b> I’ve never seen anything work as well as blendSMART to make your makeup look so natural.</b> </p>

          <p>What makes it so unique is that it gives your skin <b> flawless airbrush-like makeup coverage </b> – in less time and with less product than beauty sponges or manual brushes. </p>

          <p>And it’s not just for foundation! It has <b>  different types of interchangeable brush heads </b> that let you easily swap them out to apply powder, bronzer, blush, or even your skincare products. </p>

          <h2>So What Makes blendSMART So Much Better Than a Foundation Brush or Beauty Sponge?</h2>

          <p><a href="https://puzzleeds-arrier.com/click" style="display:inline-block;"><img src="img/image4.gif"></a></p>

          <p>
          	If you are one of the women reading this thinking, <b> “Sounds amazing, but I’m not sure yet”… </b> I want you to know that I thought the same thing too… at first.  Like you,<b>  I’ve seen lots of new products hit the market promising to “make miracles happen in minutes”, </b> only to disappoint me time and time again. I assure you though, blendSMART keeps its promise!  </p>

          	<p>When I tried blendSMART for the first time, I was instantly hooked! Here are just a few of the things I love about it…</p>

          	<ul>
          		<li> <b> Achieve Professional Looking Results </b> (No Matter What Your Skin Type Is) – You truly get coverage and a finish that looks airbrushed no matter your skill level – only without an expensive machine!</li>

          		<li><b>  Achieve Great Coverage With Less Product </b> – This means you’ll have a more natural makeup application and, less product on your face so your makeup won’t clog your pores or get stuck in fine lines, and you’ll get longer use out of your favorite products so you SAVE MONEY!! (And lots of it!)</li>

          		<li> <b> Save Time On Your Makeup Routine</b> – We all know getting the perfectly even makeup blend can take some time, but blendSMART allows you to do it quicker than anything else I’ve ever used. </li>

          		<li> <b> Safe For Sensitive and Acne Prone Skin </b> – Unlike most brushes and sponges, blendSMART’s extra soft brush heads are made of antimicrobial fibers… so if you worry about breaking out from dirty makeup brushes, rest assured that won’t be a worry for you anymore. </li>
          	</ul>

          	 <a href="https://puzzleeds-arrier.com/click" class="link"><img src="img/image7.jpg" alt="Mosquitron"></a>

          	<p><b>PLUS, blendSMART comes with a 100% Money Back Guarantee and Warranty!</b></p>

          	<p>With that in mind, there’s no reason you shouldn’t give blendSMART a try!</p>

          	<h2>How Much is blendSMART?</h2>

          	<p>Well, when you consider that <b>  the average woman spends about $2,800 a year </b> on face products, then the idea of adding blendSMART – a versatile makeup brush – to your makeup tool kit for only $59.99 is a no brainer. It saves you time and money while delivering a natural, gorgeous finish every time.</p>

          	<h2>Where Can I Get My blendSMART Makeup Brush?</h2>

          <div class="fbcomment-comment-text">lendSMART is the greatest thing that has happened in my life. Makeup was a foreign subject just a year ago and I wasn't skilled in doing anything from putting on eyeshadow flawlessly and mixing my foundation on effectively. I was putting too much foundation product on my face and was constantly confused on why no foundation was giving me the look I was aiming for! Turns out that I was just doing everything wrong! (no surprise there). This brush helped me achieve that airbrush finish and was so easy to use! Didn't have to worry about if I was doing it correctly even though the finished product made it look like I did! Love this product and literally recommend it to all women, regardless of your makeup skills. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE BLENDSMART!</div>

          <div class="fbcomment-comment-text">Tried this and was immediately sold. Friends asked what I had done so told them and they had same fabulous experience. Gave to our daughter and soon to be daughter in law for Christmas. She called me within an hour of getting home to say she couldn't wait til morning to try it and felt like she'd had her makeup professionally done! She says this will be her bridesmaids gifts - BEFORE the wedding. Get one!!! Also great for applying sunscreen
